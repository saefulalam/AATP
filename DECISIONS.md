## D-001: HPKE library = pyhpke 0.6.5 (RFC 9180 gate PASSED)

- Library: `pyhpke==0.6.5` (with `cryptography` 50.0.2). Suite: KEM 0x0020 / KDF 0x0001 / AEAD 0x0003, base mode.
- Gate vector: RFC 9180 Appendix A.2.1 (Base, DHKEM(X25519, HKDF-SHA256), HKDF-SHA256, ChaCha20Poly1305). The plan called it "A.1.1", but A.1.x is AES-128-GCM.
- Result: PASS (`tests/test_hpke_spike.py`).
  - Recipient: all 257 vector encryptions open to the vector plaintexts.
  - Sender KAT: with the ephemeral derived from `ikmE`, `enc` and `ct[0]` match the vector byte-exact.
  - Fresh random-ephemeral seal/open round-trip works.
- API constraint: in pyhpke 0.6.5, single-shot `CipherSuite.seal/open` raise `NotImplementedError`. M4 must use `create_sender_context` / `create_recipient_context` + `ctx.seal(pt, aad)` / `ctx.open(ct, aad)`.
- Vector file: `tests/vectors/rfc9180_hpke.json` contains only the filtered entry (mode 0, kem 32, kdf 1, aead 3) from the official set at
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-hpke/master/test-vectors.json` (full file 5.9 MB, sha256 `61fc662f01996cd06d713dacf5e133167bd309a1f329442d53f1e21a47b3ede6`). The entry is unmodified.
